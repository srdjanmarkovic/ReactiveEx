# ReactiveEx
Reactive Extensions (also known as ReactiveX) is a set of tools allowing imperative programming languages to operate on sequences of data regardless of whether the data is synchronous or asynchronous. It provides a set of sequence operators that operate on each item in the sequence.
Data sequences can take many forms, such as a stream of data from a file or web service, web services requests, system notifications, or a series of events such as user input. 
Reactive Extensions represents all these data sequences as observable sequences. An application can subscribe to these observable sequences to receive asynchronous notifications as new data arrive.
